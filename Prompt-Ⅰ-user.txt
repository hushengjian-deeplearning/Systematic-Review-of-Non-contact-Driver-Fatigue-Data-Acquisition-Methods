Assess whether a research article focuses specifically on practical methods for detecting driver fatigue by examining its title and abstract. If the article is a review, a theoretical study, focuses on the effects of fatigue rather than its detection, discusses ways to mitigate fatigue without detecting it, or is unrelated to driver fatigue detection, respond with 'No.' Only respond with 'Yes' if the article primarily emphasizes concrete, implementable techniques for identifying driver fatigue in real-time.
Here's the article:
