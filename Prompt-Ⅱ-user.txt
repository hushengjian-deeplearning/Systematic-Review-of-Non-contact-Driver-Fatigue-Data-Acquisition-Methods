Review the title and abstract of the following article, then summarize and answer these questions using the following concise keywords:
1.Identify the specific transportation industry studied in this article. Select from: rail transportation, land transportation, water transportation, air transportation, other transportation. If not specified, indicate "none".
2.List the data acquisition methods for driver fatigue. If not mentioned, indicate "none".
3.List the data preprocessing methods for driver fatigue. If not mentioned, indicate "none".
4.List the assessment methods for driver fatigue. If not mentioned, indicate "none".

Please follow the following format strictly:
1.Specific transportation industry: [Select from: rail, land, water, air, other, or "none" if unspecified]
2.Data acquisition methods: ["Category1": "Specific method1","Specific method2" ...，"Category2": "Specific method1"]
3. Data preprocessing methods: ["Method", ...]
4. Driver fatigue assessment methods:["Category1": "Specific method1","Specific method2" ...，"Category2": "Specific method1"]

Guidelines:
1.Provide factual information only; avoid extrapolation
2.Use brief keywords, not lengthy descriptions
3. Include all relevant methods mentioned, not limited to common examples
4. If the specific method is not mentioned, do not show it

Example output:
1. Specific transportation industry: ["land"]
2. Data acquisition methods: ["Physiological": "EEG", "Behavioral": "Eye tracking"]
3. Data preprocessing methods: ["Noise removal", "Feature extraction"]
4. Driver fatigue assessment methods: ["Machine learning": "SVM"]
